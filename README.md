This project applies machine learning models to two real-world problems:

• Time Series Forecasting using ESN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM to predict benzene (C6H6) levels from air quality data.

• Traffic Classification using SVM, MLP, and Random Forest to classify traffic conditions into Heavy, High, Normal, and Low.
